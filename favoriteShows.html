    <h1>Favorite Stories</h1>
<div class = "introduction">
    <p>My favorite kind of TV show is <b>anime</b>. Anime consists of many different genres, and has been popular since the 1950s!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>"Astro Boy" was of the first manga/anime series, serialized in 1952. It was written by Osamu Tezuka! One of my favorite artists, Yoh Yoshinari was a partner of Tezuka.</li>
        <li>I started watching anime when the famous anime, "Attack on Titan" was in the process of releasing their second season (Around 2017). I watched AOT, Free, Ouran Highschool Host Club, and some of Kiss Him Not Me before taking a break to revisit anime during the quarantine. </li>
        <li>I'm also an avid manga reader. My favorite mangas include "Blue Period", "One Punch Man" and "Wotakoi". Blue Period was recently released as an anime, and Wotakoi has one season in anime. I prefer the manga version of both though. </li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Favorite Shows (not in any particular order):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Haikyuu</li>
            <li>Food Wars</li>
            <li>The Great Pretender</li>
            <li>Attack on Titan</li> 
            <li>Blue Period</li>
            <li>Assassination Classroom</li>
            <li>Banana Fish</li>
        </ul>
        <p>...and many others! I would say though, a defining feature of most of the entertainment that I tend to be be drawn towards is ones with the most dynamic characters. To be able to really enjoy a show, I want to be able to understand them and empathize with them. A character truly makes up a great plot. </p>

        <p>God there's too many. A lot of these characters I've come to truly understand by rewatching or rereading their story, giving them another chance to look awesome! The second read is always the most interesting one :)</p>
